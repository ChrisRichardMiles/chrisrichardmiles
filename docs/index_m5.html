<li>Given Walmart sales data, tasked with delivering accurate hierarchical sales forecasts over 28 days, preventing potential losses in the millions resulting from overstocking and understocking, my solution placed 77th of 5,558 teams (top 1.4%) with a simple, explainable tree-based model, using LightGBM. It is also a pip installable software package, with testing, documentation, and continuous integration, found at my github.</li>
<li>Given a novel scoring metric, I used calculus and numpy to implement a custom objective function utilizable by LightGBM models. After discovering non-convexity, I created another custom function, utilizing insights about the data and metric, which outperformed all other publicly known methods. </li>
<li>With stockout-days non-differentiable from zero-sales-days, I used probability to detect stockout days by assuming sales were Poisson distributed, finding streaks of zeroes that were unreasonably long, given the average daily sales of a product, leading to enhanced data, more effective features, and superior models. </li>
<li>With limited memory resources, I utilized principal component analysis from scikit-learn to reduce dimensionality of features, allowing more total features and better model performance.</li>
<li>Needing feature engineering that did not exist in pandas, I used numpy to calculate novel rolling window features, also giving a 20x speed up, useful to speed up data pipelines. </li>

<li>Computing rolling window statistics can be very expensive, but can be ok if we do processing in smaller sections like we do with <code>n_splits</code> in the <a href="/chrisrichardmiles/feature_engineering.html#rolling_window"><code>rolling_window</code></a> statistics calculations.</li>
<li>Datatype matter: float32 and float16 datatypes can save a lot of RAM, but be careful for float16, which might cause accuracy problems or completely break a process, like when trying to use <code>StandardScaler</code> with float16 datatypes resulted in all zeros. </li>
<li>Be careful with Pandas DataFrames. I had a lot of problems where I was unmindfully creating large copies of data, such as a saving function, looking something like <code>df[cols].to_csv(....)</code> which was making an entirely new dataframe in memory before saving. This was remedied by using the <code>usecols</code> param in <code>df.to_csv</code></li>
<li>Be careful with DataFrame names. It seems that it is better to keep the same name of a DataFrame when doing things like concating an existing df with new data. Its like pandas will use memory more intelligently. So this: <code>df2 = pd.concat([df1, pd.read_csv('data.csv')]; del df2</code> should be replaced with <code>df1 = pd.concat([df1, pd.read_csv('data.csv')]</code>. It seems like it should work the same, but my experience with RAM crashes seems to indicate the second method is much better.</li>

<h3 id="Organization-is-important">Organization is important<a class="anchor-link" href="#Organization-is-important"> </a></h3><p>The first iteration of this project was code spread accross hundreds of kaggle notebooks. I ran experiments by running a notebook and just looking at the result. It always felt ok while I was doing it, and it worked out ok, but I didn't have the results saved in a proper manner. Now I use neptune.ai to track experiments.</p>
