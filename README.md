- Here is the
  [documentation](https://chrisrichardmiles.github.io/chrisrichardmiles/)
  for this package.
- [M5 - Accuracy Sales Forecasting - 77th place
  solution](https://github.com/ChrisRichardMiles/chrisrichardmiles/tree/master/projects/m5)
- [Optiver Realized Volatility - 91st place
  solution](https://github.com/ChrisRichardMiles/chrisrichardmiles/tree/master/projects/optiver)
  (code is not incorporated into the software package, but the solution
  can still be easily reproduced by following the instructions in the
  documentation)

This package is built with [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), so the
source code, testing, and documentation are all built in the jupyter
notebooks that comprise [the github
repository](https://github.com/ChrisRichardMiles/chrisrichardmiles).

## Install

`pip install chrisrichardmiles`

## Documentation

As of 10/3/2022, the documentation at
https://chrisrichardmiles.github.io/chrisrichardmiles/ is not displaying
correctly. Since the documentation is created from the jupyter notebooks
in this repository, you can still see everything that is covered in the
docs, except that it doesnâ€™t look as nice. If you would like to see the
docs as they should be, run the following in the command line:

    git clone https://github.com/ChrisRichardMiles/chrisrichardmiles.git
    pip install nbdev 
    cd chrisrichardmiles
    nbdev_preview

Then copy and paste the url that is provided.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
