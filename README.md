# chrisrichardmiles

> A software package built to share my kaggle solutions and other code.

Check out my silver medal solutions here: 
* [M5 - Accuracy Sales
Forecasting - 77th place
solution](https://github.com/ChrisRichardMiles/chrisrichardmiles/tree/master/projects/m5)

* [Optiver Realized Volatility - 91st place
solution](https://github.com/ChrisRichardMiles/chrisrichardmiles/tree/master/projects/optiver)

This package is built with [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), so the
source code, testing, and documentation are all built in the jupyter
notebooks that comprise this repository.
