    "### RAM issues \n",
    " * Computing rolling window statistics can be very expensive, but can be ok if we do processing in smaller sections like we do with `n_splits` in the `rolling_window` statistics calculations.\n",
    " * Datatype matter: float32 and float16 datatypes can save a lot of RAM, but be careful for float16, which might cause accuracy problems or completely break a process, like when trying to use `StandardScaler` with float16 datatypes resulted in all zeros. \n",
    " * Be careful with Pandas DataFrames. I had a lot of problems where I was unmindfully creating large copies of data, such as a saving function, looking something like `df[cols].to_csv(....)` which was making an entirely new dataframe in memory before saving. This was remedied by using the `usecols` param in `df.to_csv`\n",
    " * Be careful with DataFrame names. It seems that it is better to keep the same name of a DataFrame when doing things like concating an existing df with new data. Its like pandas will use memory more intelligently. So this: `df2 = pd.concat([df1, pd.read_csv('data.csv')]; del df2` should be replaced with `df1 = pd.concat([df1, pd.read_csv('data.csv')]`. It seems like it should work the same, but my experience with RAM crashes seems to indicate the second method is much better."
